     * If the data is valid, it calls the auth service to sign in.

     *
     * The method always returns an HTTP 200 response with the result from
     * the auth service, even if the cookie was not set.
     *
     * If there is an unexpected error (for example, the auth service throws),
     * it logs the error and returns HTTP 500 with a generic error message.

     *   400: JSON with validation errors if the input is bad.
